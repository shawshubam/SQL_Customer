In this project, we set out to manage employee information and analyze salary data within a company database. 

Firstly, we established two main database tables: `employees` and `departments`. The `employees` table contained detailed employee information such as names, positions, salaries, and department IDs, while the `departments` table stored department-specific data including department names and manager IDs.

We then performed various tasks to ensure data integrity and optimize data analysis. This included altering the `employees` table to add constraints, default values, and new columns as required. Additionally, we inserted sample data into both tables to simulate a realistic company environment.

Next, we conducted several analyses on the employee data. We calculated average salaries for specific positions and across different divisions. We also implemented queries to track salary development over time, considering both promotions and departures of employees. Moreover, we identified employees earning less than the average salary for their position, facilitating insights into potential salary discrepancies.

Furthermore, we developed queries to identify top earners within the company. This involved determining the top earner per position title as well as the top earner of each department. These analyses provided valuable insights into salary structures and highlighted high-performing individuals within the organization.

Lastly, to enhance data accessibility and analysis, we created a view named `v_employees_info`, which consolidated employee information for easy reference.

Overall, this project involved setting up database tables, inserting sample data, performing data analysis tasks, and creating views to facilitate data access. By leveraging SQL queries and database management techniques, we gained valuable insights into employee salaries, identified top performers, and ensured data integrity within the organization's database. This process enables stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding employee compensation and organizational performance.
